## 1. Analysis of metabolic rate data 

i) Perform quality control and transform raw data into mg O2/kg/h oxygen consumption.

Scripts: `Metabrate_dataprep.R`,`Metabrate_slope_analysis.R`. 

Input files:  Separate file for each batch (32 batches), available in XXX (added later).

Sample information file: `Metab_sampledata_Prokkola_etal.txt`

ii)	Standard metabolic rate statistical analysis. 

Script: `Metabrate_average_analysis.R`

Input file:`Metabdata_Fishresp_Feb20.txt`.
 


##	 2. Statistical analysis of behaviour data
i)	The first behavior dataset: Angling selection experiment
Use the script `Behavdata_analysis.R`. Input file: `Behavdata_Prokkola_etal.txt`.

ii)	The second behavior dataset: Responses to predator olfactory cues. Use the script `ControlVsBurbot_analysis.R` and the input file `ControlVsBurbot_data.txt`. 

For both datasets, models are produced for three response variables: 

1. Exploration intensity (proportion of time spent swimming during the trial after emergence), modelled using a linear mixed model.
2. Latency to emerge from a shelter, which is inversely related to boldness/risk-taking behavior, modelled using a frailty model.
3. Exploration tendency (whether the fish entered a separate sector of the arena), modelled using a generalized linear mixed model on Bernoulli-distibuted data.

Finally, in `Behavdata_analysis.R`, we also calculate correlations between log **metabolic rate** - log body mass residuals (individual variation) **and** BLUPS from LMM of **exploration intensity and latency** in the individuals/trials where fish emerged from the shelter.
